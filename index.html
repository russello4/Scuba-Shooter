      <h1>SCUBA SHOOTER</h1>
      <div id="sketch-holder"></div>
      <h2>Description:</h2>
       <p>The game is simple, shoot the fish and rack up as many points as possible in the 2 minute time frame hit the shift key to save your game and hit the return or enter key to go to that save point-
Artist Statement: the idea for this game stemmed from my love of point and shoot games such as duck hunt which was featured on the NES (Nintendo Entertainment System) and  the much broader arcade games like the terminator, aliens, and big buck hunter games. In these games rather than holding the N-Zap pistol from Duck hunt and shooting you held other guns that would be seen in the movies the games belonged to, in the end all of these games used the same laser gun technology. That would have been very hard to replicate in my game so I had to resort to something way simpler and available to me which was a simple point and click method where the cursor would act as your crosshair and you would left click with your mouse or trackpad to shoot the targets (fish)<p>
